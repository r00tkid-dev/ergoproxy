Core Architecture
# Core Proxy Engine

Traffic Router: Handles all incoming/outgoing traffic flow
Security Layer: Manages security features and controls
Event System: Handles system events and module communication

# Module System

Registry: Central module management and configuration
Loader: Dynamic loading/unloading of modules
API: Standardized interface for module development
Hot-reload Support: Modules can be updated without restart

# Security Controls
1. Traffic Management

### IP Rotation

Configurable proxy pools
Automatic rotation based on rules
Support for SOCKS5/HTTP proxies
Session-based IP stickiness


### User-Agent Rotation

Customizable UA pools
Pattern-based generation
Device profile simulation
Consistency across sessions


### Traffic Signing

Request/response signing
Timestamp validation
Anti-tampering measures
Cryptographic integrity checks

2. Testing Interface
### Request Interception

Pause & edit requests live
Header manipulation
Parameter fuzzing
Content-type switching
Protocol upgrading/downgrading

### Response Analysis

Compare responses
Track state changes
